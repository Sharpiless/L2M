## üß† Overview

**Lift to Match (L2M)** is a two-stage framework for **dense feature matching** that lifts 2D images into 3D space to enhance feature generalization and robustness. Unlike traditional methods that depend on multi-view image pairs, L2M is trained on large-scale, diverse single-view image collections.

- **Stage 1:** Learn a **3D-aware ViT-based encoder** using multi-view image synthesis and 3D Gaussian feature representation.
- **Stage 2:** Learn a **feature decoder** through novel-view rendering and synthetic data, enabling robust matching across diverse scenarios.

> üöß Code is still under construction.

## üß™ Feature Visualization

We compare the 3D-aware ViT encoder from L2M (Stage 1) with other recent methods:

- **DINOv2**: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision
- **FiT3D**: Improving 2D Feature Representations by 3D-Aware Fine-Tuning
- **Ours: L2M Encoder**

To get the results, make sure your checkpoints and image files are in the correct paths, then run:
```
python vis_feats.py \
  --img_paths assets/sacre_coeur_A.jpg assets/sacre_coeur_B.jpg \
  --ckpt_dino ckpts/dinov2.pth \
  --ckpt_fit3d ckpts/fit3d.pth \
  --ckpt_L2M ckpts/l2m_vit_base.pth \
  --save_dir outputs_vis_feat
```

## üèóÔ∏è Data Generation

To enable training from single-view images, we simulate diverse multi-view observations and their corresponding dense correspondence labels in a fully automatic manner.

#### Stage 2.1: Novel View Synthesis
We lift a single-view image to a coarse 3D structure and then render novel views from different camera poses. These synthesized multi-view images are used to supervise the feature encoder with dense matching consistency.

Run the following to generate novel-view images with ground-truth dense correspondences:
```
python get_data.py \
  --output_path [PATH-to-SAVE] \
  --data_path [PATH-to-IMAGES] \
  --disp_path [PATH-to-MONO-DEPTH]
```

This code provides an example on novel view generation with dense matching ground truth.

The disp_path should contain grayscale disparity maps predicted by Depth Anything V2 or another monocular depth estimator.

Below are examples of synthesized novel views with ground-truth dense correspondences, generated in Stage 2.1:

These demonstrate both the geometric diversity and high-quality pixel-level correspondence labels used for supervision.

#### Stage 2.2: Relighting for Appearance Diversity
To improve feature robustness under varying lighting conditions, we apply a physics-inspired relighting pipeline to the synthesized 3D scenes.

Run the following to generate relit image pairs for training the decoder:
```
python relight.py
```
All outputs will be saved under the configured output directory, including original view, novel views, and their camera metrics with dense depth.

#### Stage 2.3: Sky Masking (Optional)

If desired, you can run sky_seg.py to mask out sky regions, which are typically textureless and not useful for matching. This can help reduce noise and focus training on geometrically meaningful regions.

```
python sky_seg.py
```
